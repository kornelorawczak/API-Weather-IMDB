# API-Weather-IMDB
Python program which uses open API and secure API_KEYS (imported by 'prywatne' module) to print formatted weather info and allows to simple search IMDB database. My implementation uses asynchronous way of getting data from APIs to make the program work more efficient

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install aiohttp.
```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

## Usage

-create your own python file with API_KEYS written in it and import it to the code like I did:

```python
from prywatne import API_KEY1, API_KEY2
```

-Run the program and follow instructions given in the input window
